================

This snap-in demonstrates a way to configure a page with a dynamic URL depending on the current user's primary location. Navigating to the page executes a snap-in service which redirects the user to the URL associated with their staff.primary-location. The URLs are stored as custom attributes on locations, and we've created an admin page allowing an administrator to configure those URLs.
